I have used `map()` function to loop through an array of wishes.
Each iteration of `map()` dynamically creates a `GreetingCard` component using data from the wish array.
`map()` simplifies the code by eliminating the need for manual component creation, making it easier to maintain.
Using `map()` to render dynamic components enhances understanding of React basics.
React efficiently updates components when array data changes.
